# Theory of Contradiction Fusion (TFK) - Advanced Experiments

This repository contains the complete codebase for a series of advanced computational experiments on the Theory of Contradiction Fusion (TFK). TFK is a novel framework for modeling the evolution of conceptual systems by representing ideas as vectors in a semantic space and analyzing their interactions.

This project validates several core hypotheses of TFK, demonstrating:
- The existence of **keystone contradictions** with disproportionate systemic influence.
- The **modularity of knowledge**, where concepts form semi-autonomous "continents" of meaning.
- The presence of **second-order mediator shifts**, where resolving one conflict reshapes the solution landscape for others.
- Evidence for a **Principle of Minimum Semantic Energy**, suggesting that conceptual change follows pathways of greatest efficiency in reducing systemic tension.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `tfk_validation_suite.py`: The final and most important script. It serves as a comprehensive data analysis and visualization engine that programmatically runs all key analyses and generates all the publication-ready tables and figures for the research paper.

- `experiment*.py`: A series of scripts (`experiment7_...` through `experiment13_...`) that represent the step-by-step research journey. Each script was designed to test a specific hypothesis.

- `tfk_simulation.py`: The original core simulation script used for foundational experiments.

- `requirements.txt`: A list of all Python dependencies required to run the project.

- `figure_*.png`: The output diagrams generated by `tfk_validation_suite.py`.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Python 3.9+ and the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### 1. Set up the Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository (after you've created it on GitHub)
# git clone <your-repo-url>
# cd <your-repo-folder>

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Final Analysis

The primary entry point for this project is `tfk_validation_suite.py`.

To generate all tables and figures, simply run this script:

```bash
python tfk_validation_suite.py
```

This command will:
1. Load the GloVe language model (this may take a few minutes on the first run).
2. Execute all four core analyses (Critical Point, Cluster, Cascade, and Minimum Energy).
3. Print all formatted data tables directly to the console.
4. Generate and save the following four figures to the project directory:
    - `figure_1_critical_points.png`
    - `figure_2_cluster_influence.png`
    - `figure_3_cascade_effect.png`
    - `figure_4_minimum_energy.png`
