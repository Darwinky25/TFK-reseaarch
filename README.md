# Theory of Contradiction Fusion (TFK) - Advanced Experiments & Validation Suite

## Abstract
This project provides the empirical validation for the Theory of Contradiction Fusion (TFK). The theory posits that knowledge systems evolve not through passive accumulation, but through a self-organizing process governed by a **Principle of Minimum Semantic Energy**. This repository contains the code to reproduce the key findings, including the discovery of keystone concepts, knowledge modularity, and recursive critical cascades. The full scientific paper can be read here: **[Link to your arXiv preprint will go here]**.

## Core Finding: The Principle of Minimum Semantic Energy
Our central discovery is that the dynamics of knowledge evolution are governed by a principle of maximum efficiency. We found a near-perfect correlation (Pearson's *r* = 0.9467) between a fusion's propagation strength and its ability to reduce total systemic conflict.

### About This Repository
This repository contains the complete codebase for a series of advanced computational experiments on the Theory of Contradiction Fusion (TFK). This project validates several core hypotheses of TFK, demonstrating:

- The existence of **keystone contradictions** with disproportionate systemic influence.
- The **modularity of knowledge**, where concepts form semi-autonomous "continents" of meaning.
- The presence of **second-order mediator shifts**, where resolving one conflict reshapes the solution landscape for others.
- Evidence for a **Principle of Minimum Semantic Energy**, suggesting that conceptual change follows pathways of greatest efficiency.

### Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- **`tfk_validation_suite.py`**: The final and most important script. It serves as a comprehensive data analysis and visualization engine that programmatically runs all key analyses and generates all the publication-ready tables and figures for the research paper.
- **`experiment*.py`**: A series of scripts (experiment7_... through experiment13_...) that represent the step-by-step research journey. Each script was designed to test a specific hypothesis.
- **`tfk_simulation.py`**: The original core simulation script used for foundational experiments.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of all Python dependencies required to run the project.
- **`/figures/`**: Contains the output diagrams generated by `tfk_validation_suite.py`.

### Getting Started
To run this project, you will need Python 3.9+ and the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

#### 1. Set up the Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Darwinky25/TFK-reseaarch.git
cd TFK-reseaarch

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
Install all required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to Run the Final Analysis
The primary entry point for this project is `tfk_validation_suite.py`. To generate all tables and figures, simply run this script:

```bash
python tfk_validation_suite.py
```

This command will:
1. Load the GloVe language model (this may take a few minutes on the first run).
2. Execute all four core analyses (Critical Point, Cluster, Cascade, and Minimum Energy).
3. Print all formatted data tables directly to the console.
4. Generate and save the four key figures to the project directory.
