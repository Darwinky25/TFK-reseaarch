# The Two-Law Theory of Semantic Dynamics - A Computational Framework

## Abstract
This project provides the complete codebase and empirical validation for the Theory of Semantic Resolution (TSR), a novel framework for modeling the evolution of knowledge systems. Our research began with the hypothesis of a simple "Principle of Minimum Semantic Energy." However, rigorous experimentation falsified this initial idea, leading to the discovery of a more profound and accurate model: that knowledge dynamics are governed by the interplay of two fundamental, competing forces: The Law of Influence (creativity, disruption) and The Law of Stability (coherence, reasoning). This repository contains the code to reproduce all key findings, from the falsification of the initial hypothesis to the definitive deconstruction of the two primary forces. The full scientific paper can be read here: [Link to your arXiv preprint will go here].

## Core Finding: The Two-Law Duality
Our central discovery is that the evolution of ideas is not a simple process of stabilization, but a complex trade-off. We have isolated and measured the two primary forces that govern this dynamic: Influence (Σ P_r) and Stability (ΔE_system). Our key experiment deconstructs the "force profiles" of different types of resolutions, proving these two laws are distinct and separable.

*Figure: This plot shows the definitive proof of the Two-Law theory. The "Revolutionary" mediator (innovation vs tradition) scores in the 100th percentile for Influence but 99th for Stability, a rare event of powerful, coherent change. The "Peacemaker" (justice vs mercy) is a more common, conservative force with low scores on both dimensions.*

## About This Repository
This repository contains the complete codebase for a comprehensive suite of computational experiments on the Theory of Semantic Resolution. This project validates the final Two-Law Theory by demonstrating:
- The existence of a "conceptual backbone" of keystone concepts with disproportionately high Influence.
- The highly interconnected modularity of knowledge, allowing forces to propagate across domains.
- The definitive falsification of a simplistic energy minimization principle, revealing a more complex dynamic.
- The successful deconstruction and measurement of Influence and Stability as two distinct, fundamental forces.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `tfk_grand_unification.py`: The final and most important script. It serves as a comprehensive data analysis and visualization engine that programmatically runs all key analyses and generates all the publication-ready tables and figures for the research paper.
- `experiment*.py`: A series of scripts that represent the step-by-step research journey that led to the final theory.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of all Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `/tfk_figures/`: Contains the output diagrams generated by `tfk_grand_unification.py`.

## Getting Started
To reproduce our findings, you will need Python 3.9+ and the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### 1. Set up the Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Darwinky25/TFK-reseaarch.git
cd TFK-reseaarch

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install all required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: This will download several large machine learning models, which may take some time and require a stable internet connection.*

## How to Run the Final Analysis
The primary entry point for this project is `tfk_grand_unification.py`. To generate all tables and figures presented in our paper, simply run this script:

```bash
python tfk_grand_unification.py
```

This command will execute the entire validation suite, print all formatted data tables to the console, and generate and save all key figures to the `/tfk_figures/` directory.
